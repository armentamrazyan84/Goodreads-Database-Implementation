# Goodreads-Database-Implementation
I have implemented Goodreads Database from scratch. I used Normalization, ERD to create an optimal database design. The second phase of the project was to create 12 functions, 30 insightful queries, 10 Triggers, 10 Views and 10 Indexing of some important attributes. I have used AI-generated data to fill the database!
